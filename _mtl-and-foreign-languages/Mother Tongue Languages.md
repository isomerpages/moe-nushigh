| **Language Proficiency**: The department seeks to cater to the varying learning needs of our students from different cultural backgrounds by offering core, elective and enrichment Mother Tongue language modules. | **Blended Learning**:  Students’ learning go beyond their textbooks as they immersed themselves in project work, ICT-infused lessons and get connected to the real world by keeping abreast with current affairs. |

| **Festival Celebrations**: The celebration of Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Haji and Deepavali allows our students to embrace diversity and share their culture and customs. It’s also the chance for them to showcase their talents. | **Language Appreciation**:  Purposefully planned assembly programmes, activities and competitions are held during the Mother Tongue Language Week to engage the students to use and appreciate their Mother Tongue languages. |
