| We adapt the 24 Character Strengths by Martin Seligman and Christopher Peterson. Character Strengths are positive human qualities that are universally valued. They are lifelong leverages that students can use to build their character, enhance their well-being, improve their relationships with others and manage their life challenges.<br><br>For Cyber Wellness and Sexuality Education, our school follows the syllabuses given by MOE closely. However, we vary the ways the syllabuses are implemented, given the school context. | We aim to develop in our students the disposition towards active and concerned citizenry, and one who is proud of the history and heritage of Singapore. On top of CCE lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through the commemorative events, engagement sessions with senior civil servants and members of our alumni, learning journeys, interactive forums, workshops and panel discussions. |

#### Weekly CCE Lessons
CCE Lessons provide the fundamental knowledge and skills that students can apply in other learning platforms.<br><br>The modules conducted during CCE Lessons include Character Strength Development, Cyberwellness Education, Sexuality Education, Leadership Development, Humanitarian Education and College Guidance.
