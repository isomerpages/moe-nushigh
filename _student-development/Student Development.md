_Take a closer look at the framework and you will notice:_

_Equilateral Triangles: This signify the equal importance that we place on the various aspects highlighted within these triangles._

_Phi (pronounced as fi), is also known, as the golden ratio with the value of 1.6180339887498â€¦. It appears in many proportions of the body and animals as well as geometric construction such as the one below which is the same as our Student Development Framework. If the green line depicts a circle, the cyan line_&nbsp;&nbsp;_depicts an equilateral triangle and an orange line which cuts the midpoints of the_&nbsp;&nbsp;_two sides of the triangle and extend to the circle, then the ratio of AG to AB_&nbsp;&nbsp;_is_&nbsp;&nbsp;_the_&nbsp;&nbsp;_value of Phi._
