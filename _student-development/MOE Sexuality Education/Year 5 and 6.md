<h1><strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h1>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

relationship. This includes identifying unhealthy relationships, when to
seek help, who to turn to for support and to appreciate that one can emerge
stronger and be better prepared for future relationships.</p>

<p><em>Are values such as abstinence of sexual activity before marriage still valid in the world today? Why? Is abstinence a reasonable choice?</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson, students examine issues related to abstinence and explore
the balance between being free to make personal choices and being responsible
for the consequences of their choices. They will understand that, in the
face of conflicting voices and perspectives, they need to focus on integrity,
and choose to act in accordance with sound values and moral principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In so doing, students learn to make responsible decisions for self and
others, and think through the consequences of doing so.</p>

to make responsible decisions for both self and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are also taught to consider sexual abstinence before marriage
to remove any risks that come with casual sex. The lesson will also focus
on being a source of support for others who may be pregnant or have STIs.</p>

sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will examine what makes voyeurism wrong, learn the importance

and the importance of one’s moral compass in responsible decision-making

<p>In this lesson, students will recognise that some segments of society
may inaccurately reflect the efforts needed to maintain healthy relationships,
leading to skewed assumptions of sexual messages and connotations within
relationships.</p>
<p>Students will understand how societal influences can skew one’s understanding
of gender stereotypes (e.g. boys should not cry, and are to suppress emotional
sensitivity so as not to seem weak; girls are physically weak and unathletic,
and downplay achievements so as to fit in), which can affect interactions
and relationships in ways that are harmful to themselves and others.</p>

<h3><strong><em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</h3>
<ol start="6" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>eTeens is a programme that was developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide JC/MI Year 1 students with accurate information on STIs/HIV and protection from a health perspective. With the formation of the Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme would now be managed by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of HPB. The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students learn the health, social and financial implications of STIs/HIV
on an individual and the family, and the importance of responsible decision-making
and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
