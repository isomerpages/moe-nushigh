| **Real world connections:** Our students see biology come alive with a curriculum that is packed with well-crafted experiments and field work. Our biology laboratories are well equipped to handle a wide range of experiments. | **Authentic Assessments** allow both the teacher and student to focus on skill sets that are relevant in the real world. These assessments are often interdisciplinary in nature. Here, you see the Year 5 biology majors in their outdoor fieldwork at Lazarus Island. |

| **A Comprehensive Syllabus** allows our students to appreciate the various facets of biology, from microbiology to human anatomy (a discussion on the cardiac cycle is captured above) to ecology. | **Experiential Inquiry** creates wonderment in our students, as they work together to make sense of what they observe in the environment around them. Here, a group of year 1s are sampling the grass patches in front of the school. |
