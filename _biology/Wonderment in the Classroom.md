				<b>Real world connections:</b>&nbsp;Our students see biology come alive with a curriculum that is packed with well-crafted experiments and field work. Our biology laboratories are well equipped to handle a wide range of experiments.
			</td>
			<td style="text-align:center">
				<b>Authentic Assessments</b>&nbsp;allow both the teacher and student to focus on skill sets that are relevant in the real world. These assessments are often interdisciplinary in nature. Here, you see the Year 5 biology majors in their outdoor fieldwork at Lazarus Island.

				<b>Experiential Inquiry</b>&nbsp;creates wonderment in our students, as they work together to make sense of what they observe in the environment around them. Here, a group of year 1s are sampling the grass patches in front of the school.
