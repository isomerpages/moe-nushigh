#### **Background**
NUS High School became a Centre of Excellence for Science & Research in the West Zone in 2012. There is a strong culture of scientific inquiry and research in NUS High which we hope to support in other schools. Our objectives are as follows:

1\.  To champion quality learning in Science & Research through developing teacher capacity & facilitating collaborative inquiry to create innovative pedagogy that will engage and deepen students' learning.<br>
2\.  To provide platforms for Science teachers to collaborate to become competent professionals.<br>
3\.  To raise the professional standards in the learning and teaching of Science.<br>
4\.  To facilitate collaborations among relevant partners.

The WZCOE for Science & Research hopes to achieve these objectives through the formation of Networked Learning Communities (NLCs) within and beyond NUS High School.
