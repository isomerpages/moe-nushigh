#### **Introduction**
NUS High School welcomes students to our Nobel Science Camp 2016, a four-day non-residential programme at NUS High School where students will get the opportunity to conduct several Nobel prize-winning experiments across all three sciences.

The topics for the experiments, which will be conducted over the first three days of the Nobel Science Camp, are shown below.

| Discipline | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Physics | Holography | Bragg Diffraction | Nuclear Physics |
| Chemistry | Separation using Chromatography | Conductivity of Solutions | Azo-Dye Synthesis |
| Biology | RNAi | Forensic DNA Fingerprinting | Animal Behaviour |
|

These experiments have been carefully selected to help students gain a clearer insight to topics within the national science curriculum. They will also learn the stories behind the Nobel prize-winning scientists as well as their exciting journeys towards their discoveries.  

As part of the programme, special lectures and field trips will be conducted for students to see Science in action in both industries and academia. Through interaction with peers from different schools, students can also form new friendships and networks to pursue their common interest in Science.

This year, we are delighted to have Professor Ei-ichi Negishi as a distinguished speaker at the Nobel Science Camp 2016. Professor Negishi, along with Professors Richard Heck and Akira Suzuki, was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, for “palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis".

Professor Negishi will deliver a keynote address on the morning of 21 November, Monday, exclusively for our Nobel Science Camp participants.

We are also privileged to have Mr Johann Krawczyk, who directs the Department of Physics at XLAB, a world-famous teaching laboratory for high school and university students based in University of Göttingen, Germany. Mr Krawczyk has over three decades of teaching experience as a physics teacher and was instrumental in setting up the physics department at XLAB in 2003. Students and teachers will be able to attend some of his experimental workshops and lectures during the camp.

##### **Camp Details**
**Date** : 21 to 24 November 2016 **(non-residential camp)**<br>
**Location** : NUS High School (20 Clementi Avenue 1, S129957)<br>
**Open to** : All JC students or equivalent<br>
**Fees** : Free of charge

##### **Application**
All Science teachers are welcome to nominate outstanding students in your school to participate in the Camp. Schools are advised to submit no more than eight nominations (ranked in order). Due to limited places and resources, we advise early registration and may adjust the confirmed registrations from each school accordingly. Schools may submit nominations using the application form sent to schools, and send it to [nhstyl@nus.edu.sg](mailto:nhstyl@nus.edu.sg) (cc-[davinci@highsch.nus.edu.sg](mailto:davinci@highsch.nus.edu.sg)). Registration will close on 16 September 2016.

Students will be able to participate in one of the three experiments each day. Students will be asked to rank their choices from most preferred to least preferred. We will do our best to assign students to their preferred experiments, depending on the signups received.
