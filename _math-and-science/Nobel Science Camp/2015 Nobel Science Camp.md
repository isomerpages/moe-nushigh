#### **Introduction**
NUS High School welcomes students to our Nobel Science Camp 2015, a four day programme at NUS High School where students will get the opportunity to conduct important Nobel prize-winning experiments across all three sciences. This year, students will not only be able to conduct experiments from the individual sciences but also exciting practicals that incorporate multiple disciplines. Students will also be able to see how different sciences can overlap, enhance and complement each other in our interdisciplinary science practicals.

The topics for the subject-specific experiments and interdisciplinary practicals are shown below:

<center><b>Subject-specific experiments</b></center>

All students will be able to attend and carry out all the interdisciplinary practicals. For the subject-specific experiments, students will have to choose the experiments from one science and attend both experiments conducted for that particular science during the camp.  

These experiments and practicals have been carefully selected to help students gain a clearer insight to topics within the national science curriculum in ‘O’ and ‘A’ le vels. They will also learn the stories behind the Nobel prize-winning scientists as well as their exciting journeys towards their discoveries.

As part of the programme, students will also participate in special lectures and field trips to see physics in action in both industry and academia. Through interaction with peers from different schools, they will be able to form new friendships and networks to pursue their common interest in science.
