#### **Let's Reconnect!** 
The pandemic has brought about many shifts in the current times and all of us have been working hard to adapt to the continual changes. Despite, NUS High would like to continue engaging our alumni as an invaluable stakeholder. We are thus organising a Virtual Homecoming for alumni, hoping to keep the alumni network growing even during these challenging times. As this is a virtual event, we are keeping the meetings smaller based on cohorts, where you will be able to catch up with your batch mates as well as ex-teachers. You may also attend the meetings for other cohorts should you have juniors/seniors whom you would like to catch up with.

**The event will take place on 7th August. Each cohort will have a different meeting link, and the timings of the various meetings are as follows. Please click onto the year to access the meeting link.**

_\*Note that you will be brought to a zoom registration page, before you are emailed the link to the meeting._
