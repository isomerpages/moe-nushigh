Welcome to NUS High School of Mathematics and Science!

In a span of just 21 years, NUS High has established herself as a touchstone of mathematics and science education around the world. Our alumni are pursuing their aspirations in top universities both locally and overseas, and many have established themselves in research, technopreneurship, civil service and private sectors, in both STEM and non-STEM domains . Our students continue to do us proud on the international stage and at the national level, from the building and launching of our very own nanosatellite NUSHSat1, to their stellar performance in Olympiad Competitions. The remarkable successes of this young institution are the result of the pioneering efforts of the NUS High Family; the former and current Boards, principals, staff, alumni, parents and students have worked hard to create a caring, vibrant and innovative learning environment where students are both challenged and supported.

Providing a unique 6-year curriculum that culminates in our very own NUS High School Diploma, the school nurtures students who are passionate lifelong learners accustomed to thinking differently, innovative problem solvers and pathfinders. While our students are availed of a customised education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), their exposure to the languages, humanities and the arts is ensured to equip them with a diverse skill-set that prepares them for success in all areas. Our co-curricular activities, student-initiated interest groups and special programmes provide a broad experience that enables our students to become well-rounded learners. Underpinned by a rich and varied curriculum, research institutes, tertiary institutions, industries and overseas partners provide authentic learning opportunities to better the learning experiences for our students as they Experiment, Explore and Excel within and beyond the classrooms.

Our School Values - Wonderment, Integrity, Service, Excellence, Resilience and Humility - are at the heart of everything that we do. Our students are encouraged to explore their interests, further their passions and strive to excel in both STEM and non-STEM areas. The level-wide Values-in-Action activities and the Humanitarian Education and Empowerment Programme reaffirm our commitment to serve our community; our students harness their STEM talents to contribute to the society-at large with humility. The NUS High culture is built upon our School Values as it is imperative that, alongside academic excellence, our students are groomed to be responsible, resilient and empathetic citizens.

Our vision is to nurture future-ready Pioneers, Humanitarians and Innovators for the world, Indeed, NUS High is a place of discovery and growth and I believe that the holistic education that our students receive will help them develop a spirit of independence, resilience and confidence that will enable them to thrive in a rapidly-changing world.

Experiment, Explore Excel!
