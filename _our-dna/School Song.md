With the birth of the school in 2005, staff and students had the opportunity to write and compose the school song which reflected their dreams and aspirations. The NUS High School song was put together by students from the first Student Council and Dr Emilia Wong, the current Head of Music and Art Department, arranged the piano accompaniment and later orchestrated the score for the school orchestra. It is a song that will resonate with the staff and students for years to come.

Lyrics:<br>
As the school flag flies up high,<br>
Rising up towards the sky,<br>
All our hearts rejoice,<br>
Singing in one voice,<br>
For our spirit never dies.<br>
  
Burning passion deep inside,<br>
With faith, hope and foresight,<br>
Scaling greater heights in one big stride,<br>
For NUS High we fight.   
  
Arise young minds together,<br>
The seeds have just been planted<br>
In our souls the flames ignite,<br>
As we show our might.   
  
Burning passion deep inside,<br>
With faith, hope and foresight,<br>
Scaling greater heights in one big stride,<br>
For NUS High we fight... For NUS High we fight!
