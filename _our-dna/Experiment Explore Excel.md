### **Student Interest Groups (SIGs)**

SIGs are a unique feature of NUS High. A ground-up initiative from the students, these groups pull together like minded students passionate in their respective fields. SIGs are vibrant communities that incubate and birth new ideas, experiments and projects beyond the formal curriculum. Supported by the staff in our academic departments, the SIGs help to promote wonderment in their disciplines not just within the school’s community, they also are an invaluable help with the school’s outreach to the external community.
