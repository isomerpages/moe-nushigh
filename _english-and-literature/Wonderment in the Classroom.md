Teachers foster a rich environment for communication that will explicitly foster listening and speaking skills. They actively engage students by encouraging participation in their learning, boosting their confidence in the use of the language, and promoting collaboration among learners from different socio-cultural backgrounds. There is a focus on mutual respect in considering and objectively evaluating competing voices and views. These activities provide the space for students to participate actively in a safe environment and to form opinions based on reasoned evaluation and respond to issues with maturity.

Other than written time-based assessment conducted in test and examination setting, a variety of alternative assessments are assessed in every module. Alternative assessments provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their key understandings of the big ideas in the topic and perform a meaningful task, usually based on real world situations. Students apply higher order thinking to synthesize their knowledge of content and acquisition of skills to offer solutions and perspectives on the given issue. In the design of alternative assessments, the principles of project-based learning, multimodality, oral contextualisation are adopted. Oral communication features prominently in the performance tasks.

Values of empathy, open-mindedness and wonderment are fostered. Empathy and open-mindedness underpins the schoolâ€™s vision of cultivating future-ready humanitarians and innovators. Wonderment is a core school value that will shape the way students perceive and navigate new knowledge of the future. Students will hone future-ready capabilities as confident presenters, self-directed learners and collaborative team players. These attributes are aligned to the 21st century competencies outlined by the Ministry of Education. Through frameworks, questioning techniques and assessment tasks, students are encouraged to analyse readings and world events critically before coming up with creative products and solutions.
