| **Training of Process Skills** is important in the learning mathematics. These are knowledge skills involved in the process of acquiring and applying mathematical knowledge such as abstraction & reasoning, decision making, communication, collaboration and thinking skills. | **Alternative Assessments** are used to allow students to apply their learning in real world contexts. For example, Year 4s have to design book covers using curve transformations. |

| **Connections** between mathematics and our daily lives are made during lessons. Here, Year 2 students explore the concept of angle of elevation out of the classroom using their own made clinometer. | **Concepts focusing on statistics, probability and analysis** take place in the specialization years. Here, Year 6 students explore the chi-square test for goodness of fit (statistics) using M&M chocolates and record down their observations (collaborative work). |
