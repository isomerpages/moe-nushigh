Year 5 student Kin Hern was awarded the 1st Prize with the math research project he carried out with Timothy Ho (Year 5) titled “Regular Matchstick Graphs”. The project was mentored by our Math Department teacher, Dr Lee Chan Lye.

These beautiful patterns are constructed based on mathematical relationships. Do you know how many lines are equal in length in these patterns? How many lines branch out from each point? The fascinating patterns you see here are regular matchstick graphs, the novel creation of Year 5s Tan Kin Hern and Timothy Ho. Intrigued by the mathematics used to create such graphs, the two boys spent many months drawing these graphs, and detailing mathematical proof for them. Research mentor Dr Lee Chan Lye from our Mathematics Department also gave much support and encouragement. We are very happy that Kin Hern has been awarded the 1st Prize at A\*STAR Talent Search for the passion and ownership displayed in the execution of the project. Congratulations to the two boys!  
  
At the same time, for the 6th consecutive year, NUS High has won the top institution at the A\*STAR Talent Search. Year 5 student Kin Hern was awarded the 1st Prize with the math research project he carried out with Timothy Ho (Year 5) titled “Regular Matchstick Graphs”. Two other Year 6 NUSH students reached the finals of the Talent Search and received commendation awards - Clive Seet (his research partner was Teh Jia Tong) with his chemistry project “A novel approach for carbon dioxide methanation”, as well as Yeow An Tze (his research partner was Ranen Chua) for his engineering project on “Compact electromagnetic pulse hammer”. Congratulations to our students!
