Convocation is a special occasion when we mark the end of our graduands' education at NUS High School. Beyond the awards presented and achievements recognized, it is a meaningful time of deep reflection, words of wisdom and heartfelt gratitude.  
  
In her opening address for Convocation 2019, our Principal, Mrs Lee Bee Yann shared an anecdote on her Mount Fuji climb and reflected how a journey taken together to reach goals safely is a happier and more fulfilling one. Our Guest -of-Honor, Mr Ng Chee Khern, Permanent Secretary (Smart Nation and Digital Government) gave valuable advice on the age-old quest for happiness, broken down into three elements: the good life, the meaningful life and the dutiful life. Valedictorian Tan Yong Yi expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the fellow graduands who had journeyed with him. There wasn't a dry eye in the house he dedicated his success to his parents and shared that the photo in his wallet is a reminder of whom he fights for.  
  
As the Class of 2019 embarks on the next phase of their lives, we wish them all the best in their future endeavors!
