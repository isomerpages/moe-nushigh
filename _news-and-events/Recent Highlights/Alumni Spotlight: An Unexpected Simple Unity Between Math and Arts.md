Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, to transform a flat piece of paper into a refined sculpture. To many, it may be a simple hobby for leisure or to show appreciation with a gift. But to those enthusiasts who take a deeper dive into origami, more nuance reveals itself. This is the story of Cheng Herng Yi’s experience in exploring his passions in math and art.

Herng Yi graduated from NUSH in 2011, did his undergraduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is currently pursuing his PhD in mathematics at the University of Toronto. 

In NUSH, Herng Yi had an interest in origami, spending much of his free time folding various origami objects for leisure. He enjoyed the beauty that could be formed from such a common and simple household object: paper. As he continued folding origami, he started to value his ability to express creativity in his origami pieces. He grew interested in various ways of tweaking origami folding methods to make his pieces more lifelike. As it were, he also had an interest in mathematics and pursued independent research projects in the area. The stars really aligned when the Head of Department for Math noticed his interest and encouraged him to take up a project for the Singapore Mathematics Project Festival relating to origami design. Under the guidance of a mentor, he conducted 3 projects about various geometric blocks that could be folded and fused. This culminated in his project “Composing Frusta to Fold Polyhedral Origami”. He then presented his project at the International Science and Engineering Fair 2011, the world’s largest international pre-college science fair, and achieved the 1st prize in his category. This sequence of events was all triggered by him deciding to pursue his interest in origami and in taking this pursuit to the next level.
