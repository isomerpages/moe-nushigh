#### NUS High Alumni in NParks

NUS High may only share two letters with NParks, but we certainly have more than two alumni in there! In fact, out of the 7 employees we found, we managed to snag an interview with 4 of them. Meet Dayna Cheah (Class of 2017), Jonathan Tan (Class of 2013), Yeoh Yi Shuen (Class of 2014) and Dillen Ng (Class of 2012).
