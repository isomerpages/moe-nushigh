The Sustainable Development Youth Convention (SDYC) is a 3-day Model United Nations (MUN) conference organised by the Humanities Interest Group of NUS High School. SDYC 2019 took place from 23—25 August, and is especially significant since it is the 10th anniversary of hosting the conference by the students, for the students.  
  
During the three days, delegates partook in rigorous discussions on sustainable development, toured the NUS High’s specialised laboratories, engaged in hands-on environmental science activities and most importantly, forged friendships with one another.  
  
Indeed, SDYC is a conference that marries the disciplines of the arts and the sciences, and reflects NUS High students’ passion in advocating sustainable development through critical analysis and scientific methods.
