“Technology has no inherent morality, but whether it is right or wrong lies in the hands of the people who control it”. Alexandra Loh (Year 6), who takes Computer Science at honours level, came in 1st place in her age category at the 2021 Science Chronicles competition organized by Singapore Science Centre.    
  
What are the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) in our world? In her story, Alexandra focused on how a practice called dimensionality reduction sometimes used in in machine learning can result in assumptions and generalisations leading to ethical dilemmas. “I believe that both writing and maths and science require certain skills such as analysis and creativity. Both can uncover new insights about the world and how we perceive natural phenomenon as well as the people around us. In addition, I also think that both are valuable subjects that can create a large impact on our surrounding community.”
