Under the Humanitarian Education Programme, all Year 5s embark on 6-month-long projects that seek to contribute and serve the needs of various sectors in the community.  

One such project undertaken this year was in collaboration with Loving Hearts Multi-Service Centre, where our students reached out to underprivileged children in the areas of science, english and computing. “One thing I greatly admired was the children’s undying optimism and resilience. No matter how many times they failed, they never gave up.” shares Hong Meng, one of the NUS High students involved in the project. [Read this article](https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/our-community/temasek-gives/community/NUSHS-The-Power-of-Empathy#.Xd87tEkmUfc.facebook) for a fuller glimpse of the journey that Hong Meng and his friends undertook. The enriching experience has touched the lives of the beneficiaries, but our students as well.

We would like to thank Temasek Foundation for their support in the programme.
