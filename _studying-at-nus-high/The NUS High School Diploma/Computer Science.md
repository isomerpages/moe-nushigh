## Computer Science
The Computer Science curriculum in NUS High School is divided into two key stages – Foundation and Specialisation Years. 

In the Foundation Years (Year 1 to 3), students are exposed to a breadth of topics in Computing so that they can appreciate what the study of Computer Science is about. In particular, all students will be required to read CS1131 Computational Thinking in Year 1 Semester 2. Computational thinking is taking an approach to solving problems, designing systems and understanding human behaviour that draws on fundamental concepts in computer science. Via this module, students will be exposure to three key areas in Computer Science: 1) Problem Solving, 2) Programming Principles &amp; Concepts and 3) Data Skills. The modules in the Foundation Years aim to ignite students’ interest and passion in Computer Science, and also serve as a foundation for many modules offered in the later years. 

In the Specialization Years (Year 4 to 6), students will be exposed to more advanced Computer Science concepts, and relate these ideas to the diverse computing systems and applications in real life. 

The Department offers both Major in Computer Science and Major with Honours in Computer Science. To qualify for reading a Major with Honours in Computer Science, students have to achieve consistently excellent results in their Core modules.
#### Why is Computer Science such an important subject? 
Our students find the answer through their curriculum. Find out moreabout the skill sets gained through the [Programme of Studies](https://staging.d1bl70m167uzkq.amplifyapp.com/studying-at-nus-high/the-nus-high-diploma/programme-of-studies/).
