## English Language and Literature
The English Language and Literature Curriculum aims to nurture students who are worldready thinkers and communicators. Students will communicate effectively in varied contexts as a result of their development in listening, reading, speaking and writing. More importantly, it seeks to develop in students a broad and mature understanding of a range of subject matter pertaining to the local and world affairs as well as the ability to analyse and evaluate them critically and creatively. In addition, the programme hopes to cultivate studentsâ€™ literary consciousness, lifelong interest in the language, love for and appreciation of texts of varied genres, which will enable their journey in self-directed learning. 

The curriculum adopts a constructivism approach, which engages the learner in making meaning from authentic texts and using language in real-world contexts. For every module, an integrated and holistic strategy is used, to ensure acquisition of key language skills in listening, reading, speaking and writing. Class time will be devoted to critical and creative thinking, decision-making, learning-focused interaction and problem-solving in authentic contexts.
