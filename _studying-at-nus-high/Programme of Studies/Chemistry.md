_The Chemistry curriculum, which takes on a spiral approach, delivers a meaningful learning experience for every student, and nurtures the student as an inquirer. It is designed to instil depth in the understanding of fundamentals, and to gain competency in solving chemical problems._   

_The objectives of the Foundation Years 1 - 3 are to build a strong understanding of basic and essential concepts in Chemistry, and to develop an appreciation for the subject. Through an astute observation of the physical world using a chemical lens, topics introduced cover a wide breadth using a conceptual approach.  In the Foundation Years, Junior High students can look forward to learning about the Periodic Table, reactions of acids and bases, structure and bonding of materials, and basic organic chemistry amongst other topics._ 

_In the Specialisation Years 4 - 6, students will be introduced to more advanced concepts such as Equilibria, Energetics and Thermodynamics. They will also have hands-on experience in chemical synthesis, purification and analysis. Building on students’ firm foundation, topics are covered with greater depth in the senior years. Students often engage in laboratory activities where they learn about the process of scientific investigations and basic laboratory skills. These skills intensify at higher levels to encourage students to take on independent research to complement the theory covered in class.   The Department offers Chemistry Major with Honours for students who have an aptitude for and interest in the subject. To qualify for the aforementioned, students must achieve excellent results in the Core modules. Students also have the option of sitting for the Advanced Placement Chemistry examination in Year 6._

Many say **Chemistry is the Central Science.**<br>
