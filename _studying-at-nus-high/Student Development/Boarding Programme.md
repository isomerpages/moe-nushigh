<center>NUS High Boarding School is a home away from home where our boarders build lasting friendships, grow more confident and independent while developing the school values of WISER with Humility (Wonderment, Integrity, Service, Excellence, Resilience).</center>

<center>NUS High Boarding School opened its door on 20 Dec 2005 and welcomed its first boarders on 26 Dec 2005. A 12-storey block, 416 bed facility set in the NUS High School Campus, the Boarding School was envisaged to provide boarding experience for all NUS High School students through a compulsory one year stay at Year 5 of their study. Initially called NUS High School Residence, the Boarding School was re-named NUS High Boarding School at the end of 2007 to reflect the Boarding programme piloted by the Ministry of Education for 2008.</center>

<center>Special features introduced to support the programme are enrichment activities, extended time and space for research, extended leadership opportunities and student initiated activities.<br><br>The year starts with Games Day, an orientation activity for boarders to come together and get to know more new friends. Throughout the course of the year, Inter-Cluster Sports & Games see boarders participating in Ultimate Frisbee, Tchoukball, Bridge and other activities. There are also workshops that Boarding Leaders plans and executes. These include workshops where the Boarding Leaders teach their peers cooking, balloon-sculpting, origami, Chinese calligraphy for Chinese New Year celebrations etc. Through these platforms, we hope to develop the boarders' abilities beyond the classroom and allow them to discover their hidden talents and other potentials.</center>
