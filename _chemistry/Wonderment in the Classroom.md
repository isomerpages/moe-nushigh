| **Real world connections**: NUS High students spend a lot of time in the labs! Lessons go beyond theoretical textbook answers. Interesting experiments are crafted into the curriculum to illustrate how chemistry appears in our daily lives! | **Authentic Assessments** such as carrying out experiments to investigate the use of natural materials in clearing oil spills allow both the teacher and student to focus on skill sets that are relevant in the real world. These assessments are often interdisciplinary in nature. |

| **Use of cutting edge technology** in teaching brings the learning experience to a whole new level. Virtual Reality is employed during Chemistry lessons to help students visualise the microscopic interactions among atoms and molecules. A very useful tool to engender wonderment! | **Experiential Inquiry** creates wonderment in our students, as they let natural phenomenon guide them in building their understanding of chemistry concepts. |
