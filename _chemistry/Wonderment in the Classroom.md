				<b>Real world connections</b>&nbsp;NUS High students spend a lot of time in the labs! Lessons go beyond theoretical textbook answers. Interesting experiments are crafted into the curriculum to illustrate how chemistry appears in our daily lives!
			</td>
			<td style="text-align:center">
				<b>Authentic Assessments</b>&nbsp;such as carrying out experiments to investigate the use of natural materials in clearing oil spills allow both the teacher and student to focus on skill sets that are relevant in the real world. These assessments are often interdisciplinary in nature.
