Can’t visit us this year? Fret not! We bring our campus to you…

Our students from the Computer Science Interest Group (AppVenture), as well as our Student Leaders, have designed and come up with a virtual interactive campus tour. Check it out and play it like a game! Explore and hear our students’ sharing of their learning experience in our iconic building such as the specialised research labs, the transformed library, the concourse which is the heart of many student activities and many other learning spaces. 

Please note that the <b>game can only be played on desktops/laptops</b>. If you are on your mobile phone, please check out a preview of our school tour in this <a href="https://youtu.be/-gqxRz4KHWU">link</a> instead.
