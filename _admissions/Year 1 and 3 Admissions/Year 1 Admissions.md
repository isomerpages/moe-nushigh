NUS High School admits 100% of students through the Direct School Admission Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise and does not participate in the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise. If there are vacancies after the DSA-Sec Exercise, a Supplementary Intake Exercise (SIE) may be carried out in November before the end of the S1 Option Phase (selection of secondary schools after the release of PSLE results).

#### **A. DSA-SEC EXERCISE**
The DSA-Sec exercise comprises a two-phase selection. All applicants will sit for the Selection Tests. Only shortlisted applicants will attend the Selection Camp. Applicants will be notified of the exercise details via the main contact e-mail address registered with MOE Centralised DSA-Sec Online Portal. Successful DSA applicants are not eligible for school transfer after the release of the PSLE results and cannot participate in the S1 Posting Exercise. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are required to honour their commitment to the school for the duration of the 6-year Integrated Programme and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.

Interested applicants must register at the MOE Centralised DSA-Sec Online Portal during the application period. For more details, please refer to MOE website [DSA for Secondary Schools](https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa). Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. NUS High School can be found under the talent area of both "Math" and "Science". Applicants need to register only ONCE in either "Math" or "Science". You SHOULD NOT select NUS High School twice as you only have three DSA choices.

International students applying for admission to NUS High School do not need to sit for the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS)-Secondary test due to our specialised curriculum. However, applicants who are also applying to other mainstream schools in Singapore would need to take and pass the AEIS test before they can be considered for admission to secondary schools. Please refer to [https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/aeis](https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/aeis).

The selection criteria for all Year 1 DSA-Sec applicants to NUS High School will be based on the applicants' performance in the DSA-Sec Exercise.
