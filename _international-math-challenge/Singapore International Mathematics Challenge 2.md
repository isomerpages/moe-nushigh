The SIMC<sup>2.0</sup>&nbsp;is the successor to the Singapore International Mathematical Challenge (SIMC). The SIMC was an international mathematical modelling competition held biennially and jointly organized by NUS High School and MOE since 2008. In 2018, over 53 schools from 33 countries participated in the SIMC. In 2020, SIMC was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;

This year, we have adapted the SIMC to better meet the learning needs of youths in current times with the inclusion of computational modelling. We also wish to promote interdisciplinary thinking by getting participants to apply mathematics and computing to solve real-world problems. We have added the SIMC<sup>2.0</sup>&nbsp;Junior Challenge to reach out to younger students (aged 14 to 16 years old) and spark their interest in computation modelling at an early age. The SIMC<sup>2.0</sup>&nbsp;Senior Challenge retains the rigor of the original SIMC challenge, with a stronger computational element.
