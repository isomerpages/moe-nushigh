| **Computer Science Interest Group**, a.k.a AppVenture, aims to gather like-minded students and increase interest and passion in Computer Science. Students join on a voluntary basis and are given platforms to pursue their passion through leading workshops for their peers and public, and organising activities for enrichment beyond the formal curriculum. | **Organising Coding Workshops for the Public** gets the students in touch with the community. This is a good platform for our students to contribute back to the community using their talents. |
