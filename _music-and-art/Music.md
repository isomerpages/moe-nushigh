| **The annual department concert** is a platform for students on the music track to showcase their musical talent in delightful pieces for the NUS High Community. The Music and Art Ambassadors assist to coordinate the running of the concert. | **Authentic Assessment** is employed in the curriculum. Music majors have to perform in a senior music recital for their friends and family, and this also contributes to their final grade as a music major. |
