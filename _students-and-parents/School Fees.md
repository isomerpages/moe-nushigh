The supplementary fees will help defray costs of school-wide activities and programmes where each and every student will benefit. The amount collected pays for items such as the Student Protection Plan (Insurance), School newsletters/publications and other services/facilities.

#### **Collection of Fees through Inter-Bank Giro Scheme**
4\.  All fees are collected through the Inter-bank Giro Scheme.

5\.  It is compulsory for parents / guardians of students to take part in the Inter-bank Giro scheme. Parents / guardians must have a savings or current account. Fees due from students will then be automatically deducted through the scheme.

#### **Edusave**

9\.  Edusave funds (only applicable to Singapore Citizens) can be used to pay for school enrichment programmes where eligible. Instead of signing and returning the Edusave withdrawal authorization form for every enrichment programme, the school has issued the Edusave Enrichment Programme Standing Order (Edusave EPSO) for all parents to give authorization for the school to make withdrawals from student’s Edusave account for local enrichment programmes. This one-time Edusave withdrawal authorization will remain valid throughout your child/ward's school years.
    
The soft copy of the form in PDF is available here. [Form - Edusave EPSO.pdf](/files/Finance/edusave2024.pdf). 

10\.  If the balance in the Edusave account is insufficient, the school will proceed to deduct from the giro account nominated with the school.

11\.  The Edusave Standing Order can also be terminated at any time. The soft copy of the termination form is available here. [Form - Edusave EPSO Termination.pdf](/files/edusave2.pdf).
