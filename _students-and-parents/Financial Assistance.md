NUS High School supports financially needy students with an array of financial assistance schemes. They include Ministry of Education (MOE) Independent Schools Bursary (ISB), school-based financial assistance, scholarships, study awards, and bursaries from various self-help groups and external organizations. These are available to uplift our needy students so that our students do not face resource constraints in their pursuit of academic excellence in NUS High School.


#### **Ministry of Education (MOE) Independent School Bursary (ISB)**
From 2026 onwards,&nbsp;parents and guardians can apply for financial assistance through the Parents Gateway (PG) app services or by clicking on this link:&nbsp;[https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasis](https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasis "https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasis")&nbsp;to apply using the Singpass.

Eligible parents / guardians are advised to submit their MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB) applications at the earliest opportunity, as processing may require additional time. Early submission will facilitate timely approval.

Please visit the MOE’s website for more information:&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance "https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance").
