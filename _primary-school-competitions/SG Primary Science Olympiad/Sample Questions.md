The questions are constructed based on elementary school Science curricula, reference books and other relevant sources which assess intellectual reasoning and creativity.

Participants are encouraged to read on topics provided in the following syllabus:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| <br>General content | - Science skills and methodology<br>- General health (nutrition, common disease and their prevention)<br>- Current technology development (GMO, biotech, biofuel, satellites etc) |
| <br><br>Biology | - Basic ecology (habitat, interaction, food chain and food web, population, ecosystem, life cycles)<br>- Physiology (photosynthesis and respiration)<br>- Human anatomy and function (skeleton and movement, olfactory system, auditory system, mouth, eyes, circulatory, digestive system, skin, respiratory system) and some associated diseases and problems<br>- Classifying organisms based on their food, anatomy, reproduction system and habitat<br>- Very common or endangered species names |
| <br>Chemistry | - Properties of Matter<br>- Phase transformations (solid/liquid/gas)<br>- Physical, chemical and biological transformations |
| <br><br>Physics | - Mechanics (motion of objects, static, fluid, gas)<br>- Electricity and magnetism<br>- Thermal properties (temperature, conduction, convection and radiation)<br>- Light (properties, vision colour)<br>- Forces (magnetic, gravitation, frictional force)<br>- Energy and energy change (kinetic, potential, renewable, energy conversions) |
| <br>Earth Science | - General environmental issue (deforestation, managing natural resource, pollution, water and carbon cycle)<br>- Solar system (rotation of earth and moon, earth and moon eclipses)<br>- The planet earth (structure, surface, climate, seasons, gravitation, wind) |
