| **The Humanities Curriculum**&nbsp;consists of Humanities Studies at the foundation and the core disciplines of Economics, History and Geography at specialisation. | **Humanities Investigation**&nbsp;is implemented across all levels and serves as an authentic platform to engage students in systematic investigation of real-life problems relevant to the academic discipline. Elements of inquiry are built into these problems. |

| **Critical and creative thinking**&nbsp;define the humanities curriculum. Students have to think from multiple perspectives in order to make informed choices. | **Engaged Learning**&nbsp;through the application of theory to real-life issues sparks wonderment, and developes self-reflection into our thoughts, beliefs and feelings. |
