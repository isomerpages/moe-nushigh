| **Real world connections**: Physics lessons in NUS High are not just about text-book answers. Where appropriate, lessons are crafted to make physics concepts come alive by making connections to real world applications. This makes the learning of Physics relevant and engaging. | **Authentic Assessments** such as this group project to build a projectile launcher create authentic and often interdisciplinary scenarios for students to apply their physics concepts and try their hands at solving interesting problems. |

| **Enrichment modules** allow students to explore topics beyond the core curriculum, according to their interests. [The Robotics enrichment modules](https://staging.d1bl70m167uzkq.amplifyapp.com/studying-at-nus-high/the-nus-high-diploma/physics-and-engineering/robotics-enrichment-module/), which focus on hands-on applications of physics and programming, are popular with our students. | **Experiential Inquiry** cultivates the sense of wonder innate in our students when they encounter natural phenomenon first-hand. Wonderment is a powerful instrinsic motivation that drives scientists to persevere in research and discover new science. |
