| **Enrichment modules**&nbsp;allow students to explore topics beyond the core curriculum, according to their interests.&nbsp;[The Robotics enrichment modules](https://staging.d1bl70m167uzkq.amplifyapp.com/studying-at-nus-high/the-nus-high-diploma/physics-and-engineering/robotics-enrichment-module/), which focus on hands-on applications of physics and programming, are popular with our students. | **Experiential Inquiry**&nbsp;cultivates the sense of wonder innate in our students when they encounter natural phenomenon first-hand. Wonderment is a powerful instrinsic motivation that drives scientists to persevere in research and discover new science. |
