Year 1 students who have an interest in robotics and artificial intelligence can pursue their passion further in the Year 1 Robotics Enrichment. This semester, AIS Cube engaged our students in the virtual building of robots in a simulated environment. By integrating electronics and sensor technology, our students learnt to build systems to track these robots from their computers. Trackable mobile robots are being used in many industries such has defence and healthcare. You might have also seen such robots in our food courts!
